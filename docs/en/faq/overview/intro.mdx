1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overall description of the product or functionality. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and intended uses, offering readers a clear preliminary understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and features overview in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is advisable to separate these contents into individual documents; for single functional modules, they can be merged within the same document.

2. The Importance of Introduction

With many aspects involved in a product or functional module, adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Serve as an opening to provide a consistent cognition, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Offer readers a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of the subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on explaining the fundamental understanding of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using clear language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main features.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target audience and provide them with the information of concern.

4. The Uniqueness of Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documents. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the value of product functions, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product features.

We find some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the productâ€™s position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive and need to be described in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the supported applicable scenarios of a single module.
