title: Upgrade
---

:::tip

If the parent module requires manual upgrade operations, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, and so on.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, and upgrade documents for different versions should be provided within that directory (for example, "Upgrade Guide for 3.10", "Upgrade Guide for 3.18").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view examples of the corresponding documents.
