1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overall description of the product or function. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

We generally decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and features overview as part of a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform-based products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to split these contents into separate documents; for single functional modules, they can be merged into the same document.

2. Importance of Introduction

There may be many aspects involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Serve as a consistent recognition at the beginning, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provide readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of the subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repetitive explanations regarding the fundamental understanding of the product.

3. How to Think About This Chapter of Introduction

- Concise and Clear: Use succinct language to summarize the core points of the product, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main features of the product.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information that is relevant to them.

4. Special Aspects of Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for functional module descriptions in the documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better communicate the product's functional value, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize the product features.

We can observe some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Features of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functionality systems that the product includes.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product are more comprehensive and need to be explained in conjunction based on the characteristics of different modules.

Features of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Describe the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on the characteristics and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Besides the introduction in this section, if other chapters are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be separated.

This is a short description. It specifically introduces what the expected use of \<Product/Module Name> is. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management of multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the process of migrating applications to the cloud, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-grade container cloud management platform.
