:::tip
The purpose of writing a "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concepts" introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, a brief explanation can be included in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory for a more comprehensive introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to see sample documentation.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality, which can contain the following details:

- Core Components: such as Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., illustrating the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: including introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description beneath the architecture diagram to explain the meaning of the image and the roles of its various parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a specific concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts".
