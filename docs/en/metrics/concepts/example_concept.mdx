Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.).
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concept introductions. On the contrary, it is recommended to dedicate a separate document to each concept for introduction.
For obscure and complex concepts, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible explanation.
