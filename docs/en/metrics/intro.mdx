1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or functionality modules, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It encompasses core concepts, key functionalities, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear preliminary understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to combine the Introduction, Advantages, and Feature Overview sections into a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to break these contents into separate documents; for single functionality modules, they can be merged into a single document.

2. Importance of an Introduction

The points covered in a product or functionality module can be numerous, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Provide Unified Understanding: It serves as an opening to offer a consistent perception, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provides readers with clear product background information, facilitating deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Reduces the time spent on repetitive explanations of basic product knowledge.

3. How to Construct the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding lengthy descriptions.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main features.
- Audience-Oriented: Consider the background of the target audience, providing information that they care about.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functionality modules in documents. By organizing content structurally and using clear expressions, it helps the team better communicate the value of product features, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product functionalities.

We can observe some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantages within the industry.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product will be more comprehensive, needing to be explained jointly based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the supported applicable scenarios of a single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> In addition to this introduction, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This section provides a brief description of the expected uses of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications based on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure to achieve unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the process of deploying applications in the cloud, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
