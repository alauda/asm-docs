When writing feature documentation, the person in charge of each feature should reasonably split the document pages and directory structures based on the characteristics of specific functions. Prioritize providing corresponding CLI operation instructions for users to get started quickly.

1. Overview

Feature guide documents are typically located between functional overviews and HowTo documents, focusing on a detailed introduction of a single function. It can cover a detailed description of the functionality itself.

2. Core Features

Feature guide documents should have the following core characteristics:

- Concept-oriented: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the function.
- Flexibility: Function descriptions can be independent of specific scenarios.
- Detailed CLI: Prioritize providing detailed command line operation instructions, helping users quickly realize functionalities through the CLI. Supplement this with usage methods of the corresponding functional interface.

3. Differences Between Feature Documentation and HowTo Documents

Feature documentation often accompanies some introductions to functionality usage and operations, but the distinction from HowTo documents is a common source of confusion. Their differences are as follows:

- **Content Focus**
  - Feature Guide: Answers "what" and "why," helping users understand the functionality itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Feature Guide: A systematic and hierarchical knowledge system that emphasizes concept explanations and principle descriptions.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear operational steps that focus on practical guidance.

- **Usage Scenarios**
  - Feature Guide: When users first understand the function or need to gain an in-depth understanding of functional principles.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or complete particular tasks.

- **Coverage**
  - Feature Guide: Provides a comprehensive introduction to all characteristics, configuration items, and usage methods of the function.
  - HowTo: Specific operational guidelines for a single scenario or task.

4. Writing Guidelines

When writing feature documentation, especially concerning the CLI sections, it is advisable to follow these steps:

- Identify the target user group: Determine the intended readers of the document and their needs. Understand their familiarity with the CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure the content: Divide the document into several parts, such as feature introduction, detailed CLI command parameters, usage examples, and notes. Ensure that each part is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed command explanations: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter explanations and usage examples. Explain the purpose of the command, applicable scenarios, and possible output results.
