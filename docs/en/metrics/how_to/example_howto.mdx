1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practical technical document focused on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. It combines product features with real-world applications to provide users with complete guidance on solutions.

2. Document Characteristics

HowTo documents possess the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Provide end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios.
- Highly practical: Directly address the question of "how to achieve a specific goal," emphasizing practical operational guidance.
- Completeness: Cover the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: Users can follow the steps in the document to replicate the solution in similar scenarios.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify users' specific needs and pain points.
- Determine the applicability of the solution.
- Assess the implementation conditions and possible limitations.

Audience Positioning

- Identify the target readers (such as developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.).
- Evaluate the technical background and knowledge level of the readers.
- Understand the readers' working scenarios and environment.

You can access the [Practical Guide Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/howto/example.html) for examples corresponding to the document.
