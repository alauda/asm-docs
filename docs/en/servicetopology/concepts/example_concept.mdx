Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional module (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be integrated into a single document to introduce multiple concepts; conversely, it is recommended to dedicate a separate document for each concept. For obscure and complex concepts, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible introduction.

You can visit the [Concept Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to see examples of corresponding documents.
