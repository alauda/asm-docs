title: Upgrade
---

:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade process, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for different versions (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
