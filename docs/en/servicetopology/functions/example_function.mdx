When writing functional documentation, the responsible parties for each feature should reasonably divide the document pages and directory structure based on the characteristics of the specific functionality. Prioritize providing operation instructions for the corresponding CLI to help users get started quickly.

1. Overview

Functional guide documents are usually positioned between functional overviews and HowTo documents, focusing on a detailed introduction to a single feature. It can cover a detailed description of the feature itself.

2. Core Characteristics

Functional guide documents should possess the following core characteristics:

- Conceptual Orientation: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the feature.
- Flexibility: Can describe functionality without relying on specific scenarios.
- CLI Explanation: Prioritize detailed command line operation instructions to help users quickly implement features via CLI. Supplement with usage methods for the corresponding functional interface.

3. Differences Between Functional Documentation and HowTo Documents

Functional documentation often accompanies some usage and operation introductions for features, but the difference between them and HowTo is often perplexing. Their differences are:

- **Content Focus**
  - Functional Guide: Answers "what is it" and "why," helping users understand the feature itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to do it," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Functional Guide: A systematic and hierarchical knowledge system, focusing on conceptual explanations and principles elucidation.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear operational steps, emphasizing practical guidance.

- **Usage Scenarios**
  - Functional Guide: When users are newly understanding a feature or need a deeper understanding of the functionality principles.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or complete particular tasks.

- **Coverage Scope**
  - Functional Guide: Complements a complete introduction to all characteristics, configuration items, and usage methods of the feature.
  - HowTo: Specific operation guidelines for single scenarios or tasks.

4. Writing Guidelines

When writing functional documentation, particularly for CLI-related sections, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- Identify Target User Groups: Determine the target readers of the document and their needs. Understand their familiarity with CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure Content: Divide the document into multiple sections, such as functional introduction, detailed CLI command parameters, usage examples, and notes. Ensure that each section is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed Command Explanation: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter explanations and usage examples. Explain the function of the command, applicable scenarios, and possible output results.
