1. What is the Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as an opening to the product documentation or functional module, providing an overview of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, key functionalities, target users, and intended use cases, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview based on the overall length of the document. For complex products (such as platform products that contain multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for a single functional module, they can be combined into the same document.

2. The Importance of the Introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Serve as an opening to provide a consistent comprehension, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provide readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repetitive explanations of foundational product knowledge.

3. How to Structure the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using straightforward language, avoiding lengthiness.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and primary functionalities.
- Reader-Oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information that matters to them.

4. Unique Aspects of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules within documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the value of product functionalities, allowing users to quickly understand and utilize the product features.

We will notice some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive and should be described in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by a single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Besides this introduction, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This is a short description. Specifically introduces the intended use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a Kubernetes-based container management module designed for cloud-native applications. It is the core of ACP, built on a native multi-cluster architecture that decouples the underlying infrastructure, enabling unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the application migration process for enterprises while effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly establish an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
