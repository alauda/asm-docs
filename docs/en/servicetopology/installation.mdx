If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The deployment documentation should include deployment processes, deployment configurations, uninstallation processes, and more. If the content of the deployment documentation is extensive, it can be converted into a directory and split into multiple documents for detailed introduction.

You can refer to the [Deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documentation.
