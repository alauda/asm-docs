:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concepts" introduced in the architecture are recommended to be linked to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts" chapter below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, they can be briefly explained within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view example documents.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality, which may include the following content:

- Core Components: For example, Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., depicting the relationships and roles of each component.
- Data Flow: For instance, the introduced resources, the dependencies between resources, and the processes by which resources are consumed.
- Deployment Architecture: Such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram explaining its meaning and the roles of the different parts within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanations, please link to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts" chapter.
