1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practical-oriented technical document focused on addressing specific issues in particular scenarios. It integrates product functionalities with real-world use cases, providing users with comprehensive guidance on solutions.

2. Document Characteristics

HowTo documents possess the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios
- Strong practicality: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a specific goal," emphasizing practical operation guidance
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation
- Replicability: Users can replicate the solution in similar scenarios by following the document's steps

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the specific needs and pain points of users
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution
- Assess implementation conditions and possible limitations

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, operations staff, system administrators, etc.)
- Assess the technical background and knowledge level of the readers
- Understand the working scenarios and environments of the readers
