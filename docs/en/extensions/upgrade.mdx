:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade procedures, upgrade configurations, rollback procedures, and more.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade procedures between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide," "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documents.
