1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing a general description of the product or feature. It encompasses core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and expected use cases, offering readers a clear initial understanding.

We typically decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview in one document based on the overall length. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is advisable to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they may be combined within the same document.

2. The Importance of Introduction

Given the multitude of aspects involved in a product or functional module, adding an introduction at the outset can:

- Foster Unified Understanding: It can provide a consistent perception at the beginning, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: It offers readers a clear product background, facilitating deeper understanding of subsequent details.
- Enhance Efficiency: It minimizes the time spent on repetitive explanations regarding the foundational knowledge of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize This Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using straightforward language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functionalities of the product.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information that concerns them.

4. The Uniqueness of Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better communicate the product's functional value, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize the product's functions.

We will notice some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and the functional system included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive, needing to be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Specify the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Besides this introduction section, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This is a short description. It specifically describes the expected use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is at the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture that decouples the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management across multiple clouds and clusters. This significantly simplifies the process of deploying applications in the cloud and effectively reduces operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can conveniently create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.

## \<Product/Module> Advantages

> List the advantages of the product/module in terms of performance, visualization, security, etc. It is recommended to use an unordered list format.
