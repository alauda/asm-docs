# Core Concepts

## Envoy Proxy

Envoy is a high-performance, open-source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Within the Istio service mesh, Envoy proxies form the data plane that handles all service-to-service communication. Each workload in the mesh is deployed with a sidecar Envoy proxy that mediates inbound and outbound traffic, implementing critical functions such as:

- Traffic routing and load balancing
- Service discovery
- TLS termination
- Health checks
- Advanced features like circuit breaking and retries

Envoy's dynamic configuration capability enables Istio's control plane (istiod) to push updates to proxies without restarting workloads. This architecture allows Istio to implement service mesh features while maintaining high performance.

**Example Configuration Flow**:
1. Istiod generates Envoy configurations based on Kubernetes services and Istio custom resources
2. Envoy proxies fetch configurations via xDS API
3. Proxies apply new configurations dynamically to handle traffic policies

## EnvoyFilter Resource

The `EnvoyFilter` API resource provides granular control over Envoy proxy configurations in Istio. It enables advanced users to modify low-level Envoy settings that aren't exposed through standard Istio APIs.

**Key Characteristics**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Workload Targeting** | Applies to specific workloads using label selectors |
| **Additive Changes** | Modifications are layered over Istio-generated configurations |
| **Version Sensitivity** | Tied to specific Envoy proxy versions used by Istio |
| **Execution Ordering** | Applied in timestamp order within configuration hierarchy |
