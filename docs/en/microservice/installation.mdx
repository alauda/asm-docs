:::tip

If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation is required; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The deployment documentation should include the deployment process, deployment configuration, uninstallation process, etc. If the documentation is extensive, it can be converted into a table of contents and split into multiple documents for introduction.

You can visit [Deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) for an example of the corresponding documentation.
