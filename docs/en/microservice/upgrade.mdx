:::tip

If the parent module requires manual upgrade operations, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, and so on.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be structured as a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
