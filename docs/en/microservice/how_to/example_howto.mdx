1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practical technical document focused on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. It combines product features with real-world applications, providing users with comprehensive guidance on solutions.

2. Document Characteristics

HowTo documents have the following core features:

- Scenario-oriented: Based on specific user scenarios, providing end-to-end solutions.
- Highly practical: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a particular goal," emphasizing practical operational guidance.
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: Users can follow the steps in the document to replicate the solution in similar scenarios.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the specific needs and pain points of users.
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution.
- Assess implementation conditions and potential limitations.

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (such as developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.).
- Assess the technical background and knowledge level of the readers.
- Understand the readers' work scenarios and environments.
