:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

When introducing "concepts" in the architecture, it is recommended to link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, a brief explanation can be provided within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for thorough yet accessible introduction.

You can refer to the [architecture document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view a sample document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagrams may include the following elements:

- Core components: such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., illustrating the connections and roles of each component.
- Data flow: including the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption.
- Deployment architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Below the architecture diagram, please add a description of the image, explaining its significance and the role of each part.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a specific concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
