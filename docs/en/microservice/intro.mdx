1. What is the Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It encompasses core concepts, key functionalities, target users, and intended use, offering readers a clear initial understanding.

We generally decide on the presence of the Introduction, Advantages, and Feature Overview based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), we recommend splitting these contents into separate documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined into a single document.

2. The Importance of the Introduction

The points involved in a product or functional module can be numerous. Adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: It can serve as a consistent recognition at the beginning, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: It provides readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeatedly explaining the basic understanding of the product.

3. How to Construct the Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Use succinct language to summarize the core points of the product, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main features.
- Reader-Oriented: Consider the background of the target readers and provide the information they care about.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the value of product functions, allowing users to quickly understand and use product features.

There are some differences between product-level and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive and need to be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Apart from the introduction itself, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be separated.

This is a short description. Specifically introduces what the expected use of \<Product/Module Name> is. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture that decouples underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the process of migrating applications to the cloud while effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With Container Management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-grade container cloud management platform.

## \<Product/Module> Advantages
