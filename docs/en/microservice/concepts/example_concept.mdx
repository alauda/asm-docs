Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.).
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concept introductions. Conversely, it is recommended that each concept corresponds to a separate document for introduction.
For obscure and complex concepts, it is recommended to write a separate article in the current directory titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" to provide a more accessible introduction.

You can visit [Concept Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to see examples of corresponding documents.
