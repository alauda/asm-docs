:::tip

If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation must be provided; otherwise, it may not be necessary.

The deployment documentation should include the deployment process, deployment configuration, uninstallation process, etc. If the deployment documentation is extensive, it can be changed into a directory, and split into multiple documents in the directory for introduction.

You can refer to [Deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documentation.
