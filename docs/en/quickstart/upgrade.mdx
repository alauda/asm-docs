:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, then an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, and so on.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes for different versions, the upgrade document should be structured as a table of contents, providing separate upgrade documents for each version (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
