1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section is the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overall description of the product or functionality. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and intended uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

We generally decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and features overview based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to split this content into separate documents; for single functional modules, it can be consolidated into one document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

Products or functional modules may involve many aspects. Adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Serve as a starting point to provide consistent recognition, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provide readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of the following detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repetitive explanations of fundamental product knowledge.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using simple language to avoid verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main features.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target audience, providing information they care about.

4. Unique Aspects of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for functional module descriptions in documents. By organizing content in a structured manner and using clear expressions, it helps teams better communicate the product's functional value, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product functions.

There are some differences between product-level and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantages within the industry.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive and need to be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: State the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by a single module.
