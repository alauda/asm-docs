:::tip

If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The deployment documentation should include information on the deployment process, deployment configuration, uninstallation process, etc. If the deployment documentation is extensive, it can be converted into a directory, with multiple documents explaining each section.

You can refer to the [deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documentation.
