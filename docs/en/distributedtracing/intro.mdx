1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, key functionalities, target users, and expected use cases, offering the reader a clear preliminary understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to include the Introduction, Advantages, and Feature Overview in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform-level products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to split these contents into separate documents; for a single functional module, they can be combined into one document.

2. Importance of Introduction

Given that a product or functional module may involve many points, adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Provide a consistent understanding as an introduction, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Offer a clear product background to the reader, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repeated explanations regarding the basic understanding of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using straightforward language, avoiding lengthiness.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling propositions and main features of the product.
- Reader-Oriented: Consider the background of the target readers and provide information they care about.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the functional value of the product, allowing users to quickly understand and use the product features.

We will notice that there are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and the functional system included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive, requiring combined explanations based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the features and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Apart from this introduction, any other sections that are lengthy or relatively complex can be opened independently.

This is a short description. Specifically, it explains the expected purpose of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure to achieve unified management across multiple clouds and clusters, significantly simplifying the cloud application process for enterprises, and effectively reducing operation and maintenance management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
