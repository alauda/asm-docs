Introduce common problems users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is limited, place it directly on a single page titled "Problem Handling." If the content is extensive, create a "Problem Handling" directory, with each issue represented as a separate document.

You can refer to the [Problem Handling Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) for a corresponding document sample.

:::

# \<Title: Generally the name of the issue>

## Problem Description

Provide detailed information about the environment in which the issue occurs, the scope of impact, the symptoms of the issue, and add auxiliary information as appropriate:

- Problem screenshots: It is currently recommended to use text descriptions first. If the text is insufficient, screenshots should be used. Users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Related logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this problem (which can be a single confirmed cause or several possible causes). Each cause must meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and has been verified to lead to this problem, rather than a speculative or imagined reason.
2. A detailed causal analysis must be provided, including:
   - How the cause triggered the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process through which the problem occurs.

## Problem Diagnosis (Optional)

List the specific steps for diagnosing the problem in detail. Through problem diagnosis, users can select the most likely or definite cause among multiple reasons and use appropriate solutions to address the issue. Problem diagnosis should note:

- If there is only one root cause, then diagnostic steps need to be provided. An ordered list format is recommended.
  
  ```
  1. Diagnostic Step 1
  ...
  n. Diagnostic Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes and the diagnostic steps differ, use a third-level heading to list each root cause, and provide detailed diagnostic steps under each one.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Diagnostic Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnostic Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Diagnostic Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnostic Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple causes; if there is only one cause, this second-level title should be "Solution.")

Specific precautions, prerequisites, and operational steps for addressing the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, this second-level title should be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes and each has a different solution, then each solution should use a separate second-level title, named "Solution for Root Cause 1", "Solution for Root Cause N", etc.

### Precautions (Optional)

Precautions to be considered before starting the operation. Failing to read this carefully may lead to operational failures or even more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that need to be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level title can be omitted if there are no precautions and prerequisites.)

- Operational steps are generally displayed in ordered lists. If the steps are complex, extra titles can be added for differentiation, using a fourth-level heading for each step, with specific steps listed in ordered list format below each one.
- If the operation is performed on a container platform, list each detailed operational step completely; if it is performed on a third-party platform or other software, only key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if written too detailed, we cannot ensure to update the documentation promptly with changes in their interface, which may lead to numerous problems. To ensure the long-term usability of the document, operational steps for third-party platforms should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Highlight core steps and critical operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the operational purpose and basic processes.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple causes; if there is only one cause, this second-level title should be deleted.)

This section is identical in format to the solution for Root Cause 1, and will not be repeated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent this problem from occurring again (recommendations, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This section is suitable for storing information used in the document that is not convenient to include in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
