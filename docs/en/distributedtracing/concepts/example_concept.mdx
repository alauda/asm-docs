Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional module (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.).
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be merged into a single document for multiple concept introductions; otherwise, it's recommended to create a separate document for each concept.
For obscure and complex concepts, it's advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" for a more accessible introduction.

You can visit the [concept document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to see corresponding document examples.
