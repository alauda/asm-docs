:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concept" introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concept" is relatively simple and does not require a separate documentation introduction, a brief explanation can be provided in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more detailed introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Documentation Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view a sample document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagram may include the following content:

- Core components: For example, Operator, Task, Middleware, etc., and illustrate the relationships and functions of each component in the diagram.
- Data flow: For example, the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the processes by which resources are consumed.
- Deployment architecture: For example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram that explains the meaning of the image and the function of each part contained within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a specific concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts".
