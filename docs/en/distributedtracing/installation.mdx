:::tip

If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The deployment documentation should include the deployment process, deployment configuration, uninstallation process, etc. If the content of the deployment documentation is too extensive, it can be transformed into a table of contents, splitting it into multiple documents for introduction.

You can visit [Deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) to view examples of corresponding documentation.
