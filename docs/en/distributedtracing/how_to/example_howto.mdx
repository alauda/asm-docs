1. Overview

HowTo documents are practice-oriented technical documents that focus on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. They combine product features with real-world applications, providing users with comprehensive guidance for solutions.

2. Document Features

HowTo documents have the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios.
- Highly practical: Directly answers the question "how to achieve a specific goal" with an emphasis on practical operational guidance.
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: Users can follow the document's steps to reproduce solutions in similar scenarios.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify users' specific needs and pain points.
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution.
- Assess implementation conditions and potential limitations.

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (such as developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.).
- Assess the readers' technical background and knowledge level.
- Understand the readers' work scenarios and environment.

You can refer to the [Practical Guide Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/howto/example.html) for examples of corresponding documents.
