:::tip

If the parent module requires manual intervention for the upgrade process, upgrade documentation must be provided; otherwise, it is not necessary.

The upgrade documentation should include the upgrade procedure, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade procedures between different versions, the upgrade documentation should be structured as a directory, providing upgrade documentation for different versions within this directory (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide," "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can access the [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view examples of the corresponding documentation.

# Upgrade
