When writing functional documentation, the responsibility holders for each feature should reasonably partition the document pages and directory structure based on the specific characteristics of the functionality. Priority should be given to providing corresponding CLI operational instructions to facilitate quick onboarding for users.

1. Overview

Functional guide documentation is typically positioned between feature overview and HowTo documents, focusing on a detailed introduction to a single feature. It can cover a detailed description of the functionality itself.

2. Core Features

Functional guide documentation should possess the following core features:

- Concept-oriented: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the feature.
- Flexibility: Ability to describe functionality without relying on specific scenarios.
- Detailed CLI: Prioritize providing detailed command-line operation instructions to help users quickly implement functionality through the CLI. Supplement with usage methods corresponding to this feature's user interface afterwards.

3. Differences between Functional Documents and HowTo Documents

Functional documents often accompany some introductions to feature usage and operations, but their differences from HowTo documents can frequently confuse us. The distinctions are:

- **Content Focus**
  - Functional Guide: Answers "what is it" and "why," helping users understand the functionality itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Functional Guide: A systematic, hierarchical knowledge system that emphasizes concept explanations and principles.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear operational steps that focus on practical guidance.

- **Usage Scenarios**
  - Functional Guide: When users are first understanding the feature or need a deeper understanding of its principles.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or complete particular tasks.

- **Coverage Scope**
  - Functional Guide: Completes the introduction of all features, configuration items, and usage methods of the functionality.
  - HowTo: Specific operational guides for single scenarios or tasks.

4. Writing Guidelines

When drafting functional documentation, particularly for CLI sections, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- Identify the target user group: Determine the target audience for the document and their needs. Understand their familiarity with the CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure the content: Divide the document into several sections, such as feature introduction, detailed CLI command parameters, usage examples, and notes. Ensure each section is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed command descriptions: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter explanations and usage examples. Explain the command's function, applicable scenarios, and possible outputs.
