# Query Trace Logs

## Feature Overview

Trace Logs enable users to query and analyze logs associated with a specific distributed trace using its unique TraceID. This feature helps developers and operators quickly locate issues, understand request flows, and correlate business logs with trace contexts.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify errors and latency issues across microservices in distributed systems.
- **Context Correlation**: Link business logs to trace spans for end-to-end visibility.
- **Efficient Filtering**: Filter logs by Pods or TraceID to focus on relevant data.

**Applicable Scenarios**:
- Debugging cross-service transaction failures.
- Analyzing performance bottlenecks in complex workflows.
- Auditing request processing flows for compliance.

## Core Features

- **TraceID-Based Query**: Retrieve all logs associated with a specific trace using its TraceID.
- **Pod-Centric Filtering**: View logs from specific Pods involved in the trace.
- **Sidecar Log Exclusion**: Filter out infrastructure logs to focus on business-relevant data.
- **Log Export**: Export filtered log data in customizable formats.
- **Contextual Log Viewing**: Examine log records before/after a target entry for deeper analysis.

## Prerequisites

:::tip
Before querying trace logs by TraceID, you must first instrument your services to include TraceID in business logs. Follow the [Business Log Correlation with TraceID Guide](../how_to/log_with_traceid.md) for configuration details.
:::

**Default Behavior**:
- Displays logs from the entire trace duration.
- For traces shorter than 1 minute, queries logs within 1 minute after the trace start time.

  #### By Query Conditions
  Enter keywords in the **Query Conditions** text box to filter logs based on specific content.

  #### Contain Trace ID
  Select the **Contain Trace ID** checkbox.

  #### Hide Sidecar Logs
  Check **Hide Sidecar Logs** to exclude infrastructure-related entries.

  ### Advanced Operations
  
  #### Export Logs
