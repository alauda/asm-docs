# Introduction

Distributed tracing is a key module in the observability system, used for achieving end-to-end tracing and analysis of distributed systems. This module provides a complete solution from data collection, storage to visual analysis, helping developers and operations personnel to quickly locate service call anomalies, analyze performance bottlenecks, and trace the entire lifecycle behavior of requests.

By integrating with open-source technology stacks and self-developed components, this module supports end-to-end distributed tracing capabilities: applications generate tracing data through injection or SDK integration methods, which are then uniformly collected and stored in Elasticsearch, ultimately realized through a customized UI for multi-dimensional visual analysis. Users can conduct precise searches using rich conditions such as `TraceID`, service name, tags, and more.

## Usage Limitations

When using tracing, the following constraints should be note1d:

- **Balancing Sampling Strategies and Performance**
  - In high-load scenarios, the collection of tracing data may exert certain pressure on Elasticsearch's performance and storage; it is recommended to configure the sampling rate reasonably based on business conditions.
