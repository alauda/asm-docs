# Introduction

Service Topology refers to the layout and interconnected structure between services in a distributed system or service network, primarily used to describe how service components are organized, communicate with each other, and how their dependencies are configured.

The service topology diagram provided by the platform visually presents two types of calling relationships: the Istio service mesh components (including services, gateways, and external services (ServiceEntry)), and the OpenTelemetry-monitored components (including various middleware services such as Kafka, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Redis, etc.).

Through the topology diagram, you can understand the interactions between services, quickly locate where errors occur, and how to optimize these interactions to enhance the system's efficiency and reliability. Simple operations (clicking on a node or topology line) allow you to view traffic information between services associated with a specific service or topology line.

When a service triggers an alarm, the related service nodes in the topology diagram will be marked with a prominent special tag, allowing operators to quickly identify and understand the issue through the topology diagram. Additionally, security measures and circuit breaker strategies configured for Istio services are also displayed with special markers in the topology diagram, providing a comprehensive view of the service status.
