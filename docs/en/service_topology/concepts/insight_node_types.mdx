# In-depth Understanding of Node Types

:::note

In the topology diagram, if a service calling relationship is identified that does not belong to the above clear classifications, it will be represented by an **Unknown Service** node icon to ensure the integrity and clarity of the topology calling relationships. This representation helps users comprehensively understand the structure of the entire service network.
