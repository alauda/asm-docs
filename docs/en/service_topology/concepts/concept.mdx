# Core Concepts

## Service Node

A **service node** is an independent unit or part in the system or global calling relationship, representing a specific functional component within the system. For example, these nodes may include microservices, gateways, message queues, databases, etc. You can view the supported [node types](./insight_node_types.mdx).

## Connection Line

Represents the communication path between services, such as API calls or direct data flows. When "a **connection line** goes from Service A to Service B," it means that Service A relies on Service B to complete its operations.

## Dependency

Refers to other services that a service relies on to perform its functions. This **dependency** can take various forms, with service calling relationships being the most common. For example, when “Service A depends on Service B,” it implies a call from Service A to Service B.
