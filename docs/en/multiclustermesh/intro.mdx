1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and intended uses, giving the reader a clear preliminary understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and overview of functions in a single document based on the overall length. For complex products (such as platform products that contain multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single-function modules, they can be combined in the same document.

2. Importance of Introduction

There may be many aspects involved in a product or functional module. Adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Ensure unified understanding: It can serve as an introduction that provides a consistent perception, reducing communication errors.
- Guide reading: It offers the reader a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeated explanations regarding the basic understanding of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Chapter

- Be concise and clear: Summarize the core points of the product using straightforward language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight key points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main features of the product.
- Focus on the reader: Consider the background of the target audience and provide the information they care about.

4. Special Aspects of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the functional value of the product, allowing users to quickly understand and use the product features.

We will notice some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the productâ€™s position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all the core modules and functional systems that the product includes.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive, requiring joint explanations based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the specific features and advantages of the individual module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the scenarios supported by the individual module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> In addition to the introduction section, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be separated.

This is a brief description. It specifically introduces the expected use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management across multiple clouds and clusters, significantly simplifying the process for enterprises to migrate applications to the cloud, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. Through container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-grade container management platform.
