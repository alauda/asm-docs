Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concepts; otherwise, it is recommended to create separate documents for each concept. For obscure or complex concepts, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a comprehensive yet accessible introduction.

You can visit the [concept document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to see examples of corresponding documents.
