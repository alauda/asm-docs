When writing functional documentation, the person responsible for each feature should reasonably split the documentation pages and directory structure based on the specific characteristics of the feature. Prioritize providing the corresponding CLI operation instructions to help users get started quickly.

1. Overview

The functional guide document is typically situated between the feature overview and the HowTo document, focusing on a detailed introduction of a single feature. It can cover a detailed description of the feature itself.

2. Core Characteristics

The functional guide document should possess the following core characteristics:

- Concept-oriented: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the feature.
- Flexibility: Capable of describing the feature without relying on specific scenarios.
- CLI Details: Prioritize providing detailed command line operation instructions to help users quickly realize the functionality through the CLI. Secondly, supplement the usage of the corresponding feature interface.

3. Differences Between Functional Documents and HowTo Documents

Functional documents often accompany some introductions to feature usage and operations; however, the difference from HowTo documents can often be confusing. Their distinctions are as follows:

- **Content Focus**
  - Functional Guide: Answers "what" and "why," helping users understand the feature itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Functional Guide: A systematic, hierarchical knowledge system, emphasizing concept explanations and principle elaboration.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear steps, emphasizing practical guidance.

- **Usage Scenarios**
  - Functional Guide: When users are initially learning about the feature or need to understand the principles of the feature in depth.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or complete specific tasks.

- **Coverage Scope**
  - Functional Guide: Complements introduction to all features, configuration items, and usage methods of the functionality.
  - HowTo: Specific operational guidelines for a single scenario or task.

4. Writing Guidelines

When drafting functional documentation, especially regarding the CLI sections, it is advisable to follow these steps:

- Identify the target user group: Determine the document's target audience and their needs. Understand their familiarity with the CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure the content: Divide the document into multiple parts, such as feature introduction, detailed CLI command parameters, usage examples, and notes. Ensure that each part is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed command explanation: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter explanations and usage examples. Explain the command's purpose, applicable scenarios, and possible output results.
