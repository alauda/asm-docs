1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practical-focused technical document that addresses specific problems in particular scenarios. It combines product features with real-world applications, providing users with complete solution guidance.

2. Document Features

The HowTo document has the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Based on specific user scenarios, it provides end-to-end solutions.
- High practicality: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a certain goal," emphasizing practical operational guidance.
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: Users can follow the document's steps to replicate the solution in similar scenarios.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify users' specific needs and pain points.
- Define the applicability of the solution.
- Evaluate implementation conditions and possible limitations.

Audience Positioning

- Determine the target readers (e.g., developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.).
- Assess the readers' technical background and knowledge level.
- Understand the readers' working scenarios and environment.
