:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include upgrade procedures, upgrade configurations, rollback procedures, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade procedures between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized as a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for different versions (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
