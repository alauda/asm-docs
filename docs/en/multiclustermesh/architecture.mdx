:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

It is recommended to link the "concepts" introduced in the architecture to the corresponding sections in the "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, they can be briefly explained within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to provide a thorough and straightforward introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view an example document.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagram may include the following content:

- Core Components: For example, Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., and illustrate the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: For example, introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: For example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram explaining the meaning of the image and the roles of its various parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in "Core Concepts."
