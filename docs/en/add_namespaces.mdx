title: Namespace Governance in Service Mesh
---

To facilitate fine-grained control of services within the mesh, you can limit the scope that the mesh can control by managing namespaces. Services can only be added and governed within a namespace if the namespace is managed by the service mesh.

**Note**: You can unmanage a namespace by removing it, but only namespaces without services can be removed.

### Steps

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Service Mesh** > **Meshes**.

2. Click the ***Service Mesh Name*** for which you want to set the policy.

3. Scroll down to the **Namespaces** section, select the cluster, and click **Manage Namespace**.

4. Select the namespace under the cluster and click **Confirm**.
