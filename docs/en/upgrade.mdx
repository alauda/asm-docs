:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configurations, rollback procedures, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade process between versions, the upgrade document should be converted into a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for different versions (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documents.
