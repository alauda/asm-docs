# Introduction

## Introduction Global Rate Limiting for Services
The Global Rate Limiting module protects services from overload in high-concurrency scenarios through intelligent traffic control. It enables:

- Prevention of service breakdowns during traffic spikes
- Fine-grained access control via multi-dimensional rules
- Safe capacity planning through shadow mode analysis

## Advantages
- ​**High-Concurrency Protection**: Maintains service stability within resource limits
- ​**Precision Control**: API path/method/header-based rate limiting
- ​**Risk-Free Testing**: Shadow mode simulation without affecting production
- ​**Real-Time Visibility**: Visual monitoring of throttling effects

## Scenarios
- ​**API Overload Protection**
  Safeguard critical APIs from sudden traffic surges

- ​**Sensitive Operation Throttling**
  Enforce strict limits on write/delete operations

- ​**Multi-Tenant Quota Management**
  Implement fair usage policies across client groups

## Limitations
- Requires Redis cluster integration pre-configured
- Sidecar injection mandatory for target services
- Maximum 1 global policy per service
- Regex matching supports RE2 syntax only
- Shadow mode data retention period: 7 days
