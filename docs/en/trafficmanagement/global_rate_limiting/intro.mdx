# Introduction

## Introduction Global Rate Limiting for Services
The Global Rate Limiting module protects services from overload in high-concurrency scenarios through intelligent traffic control. It enables:

- Prevention of service breakdowns during traffic spikes
- Fine-grained access control via multi-dimensional rules
- Safe capacity planning through shadow mode analysis

## Limitations
- Requires Redis cluster integration pre-configured
- Sidecar injection mandatory for target services
- Maximum 1 global policy per service
- Regex matching supports RE2 syntax only
- Shadow mode data retention period: 7 days
