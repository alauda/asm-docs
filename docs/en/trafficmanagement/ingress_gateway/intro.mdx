# Introduction

## Introduction Ingress Gateway
The Ingress Gateway serves as the secure entry point for external traffic into the service mesh, providing:

- Centralized traffic management at mesh edge
- Advanced L4/L7 protocol support
- Decoupled traffic routing rules management
- Enhanced observability and security controls

Unlike Kubernetes Ingress, it enables granular traffic routing with service mesh capabilities while maintaining operational flexibility.

## Limitations
- Requires Envoy proxy deployment at edge
- Tier1-Tier2 hierarchy needs predefined network topology
- L7 features require HTTP/HTTPS protocol selection
- TLS termination configuration separate from service policies
