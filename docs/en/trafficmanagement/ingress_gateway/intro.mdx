# Introduction

## Introduction Ingress Gateway
The Ingress Gateway serves as the secure entry point for external traffic into the service mesh, providing:

- Centralized traffic management at mesh edge
- Advanced L4/L7 protocol support
- Decoupled traffic routing rules management
- Enhanced observability and security controls

Unlike Kubernetes Ingress, it enables granular traffic routing with service mesh capabilities while maintaining operational flexibility.

## Advantages
- **Dual-Layer Architecture**
  Tier1 manages external exposure rules while Tier2 handles service-level routing, preventing rule conflicts between infrastructure and application teams

- **Protocol Flexibility**
  Supports HTTP/HTTPS/TCP traffic with mutual TLS encryption

- **Traffic Governance**
  Enables canary releases and service routing for ingress traffic

- **Operational Decoupling**
  Separates infrastructure routing (Tier1) from business routing (Tier2) management

## Scenarios
- **Hybrid Cloud Traffic Management**
  Unified entry point for multi-cloud deployments

- **Security-Sensitive Exposures**
  Enforce WAF policies and rate limiting at edge

- **Canary Launch Coordination**
  Implement phased rollouts combining gateway and service routing

- **Multi-Team Environments**
  DevOps manages Tier1, App teams control Tier2 configurations

## Limitations
- Requires Envoy proxy deployment at edge
- Tier1-Tier2 hierarchy needs predefined network topology
- L7 features require HTTP/HTTPS protocol selection
- TLS termination configuration separate from service policies
