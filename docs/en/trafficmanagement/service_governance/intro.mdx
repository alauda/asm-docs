# Introduction

## Service Governance Policies

Service Governance Policies provide traffic management capabilities through Istio's DestinationRule configurations. These policies:

- Protect services from overload using connection pools
- Ensure request reliability through retry mechanisms

Core value: Maintain service stability under varying load conditions

## Advantages
