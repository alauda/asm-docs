## Service Governance Policies

Service Governance Policies provide traffic management capabilities through Istio's DestinationRule configurations. These policies:

- Prevent cascading failures via circuit breaking  
- Optimize resource distribution with load balancing  
- Protect services from overload using connection pools  
- Ensure request reliability through retry mechanisms  

Core value: Maintain service stability and performance under varying load conditions
