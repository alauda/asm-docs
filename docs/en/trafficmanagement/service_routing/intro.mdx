# Introduction

## Service Routing
Service Routing enables granular traffic management between services through Istio-powered rules and policies. This functionality:

- Controls request flow between microservices
- Supports canary testing and phased rollouts
- Implements failure recovery mechanisms
- Provides non-intrusive testing capabilities

Core value: Precise traffic control for microservice architectures

## Advantages
- ​**Protocol Support**: HTTP/HTTP2/gRPC & TCP
- ​**Conditional Routing**: Header/URI/Source-based matching
- ​**Advanced Policies**: 5-tier traffic manipulation
- ​**Cross-Cluster**：Native multi-cluster management

## Scenarios
- ​**Phased Rollouts**
  Route 5% traffic to new version for validation

- ​**User Segmentation**
  Direct premium users to high-performance instances

- ​**Failure Testing**
  Inject 500 errors on 10% production traffic

- ​**Performance Optimization**
  Mirror traffic to staging for load testing

- ​**Geo-Routing**
  Route requests based on client region tags

## Limitations
- Requires enabled cross-cluster discovery
- Incompatible with active canary releases
- TCP routing lacks advanced policies
- Maximum 100 retries per request
