# Introduction

## Advanced Sidecar Operations

Advanced Sidecar Operations provide granular control over Istio proxy behavior. These features:

- Optimize service mesh performance
- Enable targeted troubleshooting
- Offer temporary service recovery paths
- Maintain governance flexibility

Core value: Enhanced control over service mesh components

## Advantages
- **Non-Disruptive**: Bypass mode without pod restart
- **Precision**: Port/IP-range specific passthrough
- **Diagnostics**: Runtime log level adjustment
- **Fallback**: Full Sidecar removal capability

## Scenarios
- **Middleware Optimization**
  Exempt Redis traffic from Sidecar processing

- **Performance Troubleshooting**
  Temporarily bypass Sidecar to isolate issues

- **Debugging Support**
  Enable debug logs for specific services

- **Legacy Compatibility**
  Remove Sidecar for case-sensitive header requirements

## Limitations
- Bypass mode requires Kubernetes 1.23+
- Passthrough configuration triggers deployment restart
- Removed Sidecar disables security policies
- Multi-cluster log sync adds latency
