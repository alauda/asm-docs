# Introduction

## Canary Release Introduction

The Canary Release module enables controlled deployment of service updates through gradual traffic shifting and real-time monitoring. Designed for Kubernetes environments integrated with Istio, it supports:

- Risk mitigation for production deployments
- Multi-phase release strategies (canary/blue-green/A/B testing)
- Automated rollback on failure detection
- Unified observability across release lifecycle

## Limitations
- Incompatible with existing service routing configurations
- Requires unique service naming across clusters
- GitOps-managed services have limited UI controls
- Security policies remain active during release
