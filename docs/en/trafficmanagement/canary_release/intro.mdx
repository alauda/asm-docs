# Introduction

## Canary Release Introduction

The Canary Release module enables controlled deployment of service updates through gradual traffic shifting and real-time monitoring. Designed for Kubernetes environments integrated with Istio, it supports:

- Risk mitigation for production deployments
- Multi-phase release strategies (canary/blue-green/A/B testing)
- Automated rollback on failure detection
- Unified observability across release lifecycle

## Advantages
- **Flexible Traffic Control**
  Supports manual and automated traffic splitting with 1% granularity

- **Real-Time Metrics**
  Provides request success rate, latency, and RPS tracking during release

- **GitOps Integration**
  Compatible with Git-managed deployments through CRD configurations

- **Visual Pipeline**
  Displays release progress through intuitive dashboard metrics

## Scenarios
- **Low-Risk Version Rollouts**
  Gradually shift 5-20% traffic to new version while monitoring errors

- **Feature Flag Testing**
  Route specific user groups via HTTP headers (e.g. beta testers)

- **Performance Validation**
  Compare response times between versions under real traffic

- **Emergency Rollback**
  Automatically revert to stable version when error rates exceed threshold

## Limitations
- Incompatible with existing service routing configurations
- Requires unique service naming across clusters
- GitOps-managed services have limited UI controls
- Security policies remain active during release
