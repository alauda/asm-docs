# Feature Overview

## Traffic Control

- **Dynamic Routing**  
  Supports weight-based and header-based traffic routing for A/B testing and canary deployments.

- **Traffic Mirroring**  
  Replicates production traffic to staging environments for safe testing without impacting live users.

- **Request Retries**  
  Configures automatic retries for failed requests with customizable retry conditions and backoff policies.

## Resilience & Fault Handling

- **Circuit Breaking**  
  Automatically blocks requests to overloaded services based on error thresholds and latency metrics.

- **Fault Injection**  
  Simulates service failures (HTTP errors, delays) to validate system fault tolerance and recovery workflows.

- **Timeout Control**  
  Sets service-level timeout thresholds to prevent cascading failures and improve system responsiveness.
