# Features

## Traffic Management Architecture
- **Dual-layer Gateway Design (Tier1 + Tier2)**  
  Implements Tier1 gateway for external traffic routing management and Tier2 transparent proxy for service-level routing rule execution, resolving routing rule conflicts between gateway and service layers while maintaining policy consistency.

- **Protocol Support**  
  Supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC and WebSocket protocols for external service exposure, adapting to various modern application communication requirements.

- **Dynamic Routing**  
  Supports weight-based and header-based traffic routing for A/B testing and canary deployments.

- **Traffic Mirroring**  
  Replicates production traffic to staging environments for safe testing without impacting live users.

- **Request Retries**  
  Configures automatic retries for failed requests with customizable retry conditions and backoff policies.

## Security & Access Control
- **TLS Termination**  
  Provides SSL/TLS certificate management capabilities, supporting HTTPS encrypted access and certificate automatic rotation for north-south traffic.

- **Cross-cluster Traffic Management**  
  Enables unified management of external access traffic across multiple clusters through gateway instance groups, supporting centralized certificate and routing policy configuration.

## Service Governance Integration
- **Canary Release Support**  
  Implements service-level canary release strategies through Tier2 proxy, allowing gray traffic rules configured for backend services to take effect on ingress gateway traffic.

- **Routing Policy Synchronization**  
  Automatically synchronizes service routing rules (timeout retry, traffic mirroring, etc.) to gateway traffic through dual-layer architecture design, maintaining policy consistency.

## Resilience & Fault Handling

- **Circuit Breaking**  
  Automatically blocks requests to overloaded services based on error thresholds and latency metrics.

- **Fault Injection**  
  Simulates service failures (HTTP errors, delays) to validate system fault tolerance and recovery workflows.

- **Timeout Control**  
  Sets service-level timeout thresholds to prevent cascading failures and improve system responsiveness.

## Observability & Monitoring
- **Real-time Monitoring**  
  Provides QPS, success rate, latency and other core metrics monitoring for gateway instances, supporting custom monitoring dashboards and alert policies.

- **Access Log Analysis**  
  Records complete HTTP request logs including source IP, request method, response code and latency, supporting log query and traffic analysis.

## Deployment Flexibility
- **Cross-cloud Deployment**  
  Supports deployment of gateway instances across multiple cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, private cloud), achieving unified management of hybrid cloud traffic through instance groups.

- **Horizontal Scaling**  
  Enables dynamic scaling of gateway instances based on traffic load, supporting both manual scaling and HPA-based automatic scaling strategies.
