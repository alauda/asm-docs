# Introduction

## Traffic Management Module Overview

Traffic Management Advanced Operations provide comprehensive traffic management and service governance capabilities for cloud-native applications. This module enables fine-grained control over service communication through features like traffic passthrough, circuit breakers, canary releases, and global rate limiting. It supports both inbound and outbound traffic management while maintaining high observability and security standards across multi-cluster environments.

## Limitations

1. Requires Sidecar injection for full functionality (except external services)
2. Canary release cannot coexist with existing service routing configurations
3. Pod isolation status resets during deployments/scale operations
4. Global rate limiting requires Redis cluster configuration
5. Cross-cluster service discovery constraints for canary releases
6. Bypass mode requires Kubernetes v1.23+ clusters
7. Egress gateway configuration needs regional consistency in multi-cluster scenarios
8. Policies don't apply to traffic-passthrough configured services
