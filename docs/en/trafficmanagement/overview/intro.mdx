1. What is an Introduction?

The "Introduction" section is the opening part of the product documentation or feature module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and intended uses, offering readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We generally decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview sections in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products containing multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single feature modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. The Importance of an Introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or feature module. Adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: It can provide a consistent cognition at the beginning, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: It provides readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of the subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: It reduces the time for repetitive explanations related to basic product knowledge.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main features.
- Audience-Oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information that matters to them.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing feature modules in documents. By organizing content in a structured manner and expressing it clearly, it helps the team convey the product's functional value better, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize the product features.

There are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive and need to be jointly described according to the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of this module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by a single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Except for this introduction section, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This is a short description. It specifically introduces the expected use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management of multi-cloud and multi-cluster, significantly simplifying the process of migrating applications to the cloud, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
