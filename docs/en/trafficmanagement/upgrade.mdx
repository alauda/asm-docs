:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it is not necessary to include one.

The upgrade document should contain the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, and so on.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be transformed into a directory that provides upgrade documents for different versions (for example, "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
