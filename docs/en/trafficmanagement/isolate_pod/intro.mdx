# Introduction

## Pod Isolation Introduction
Pod Isolation enables immediate traffic cutoff to malfunctioning Pods while maintaining their operational state. This feature:

- Prevents request failures from defective Pods
- Maintains service availability during troubleshooting
- Allows seamless reintegration after repair

Core purpose: Ensure service continuity by dynamically managing endpoint participation

## Limitations
- **State Constraints**
  Only affects Running Pods, excludes Completed/CrashLoopBackOff

- **Version Compatibility**
  Legacy services require label updates (asm.cpaas.io/msselector)

- **Conflict Scenarios**
  Disabled during canary releases and horizontal scaling events

- **Persistence**
  Isolation resets on pod restart or scale-down operations
