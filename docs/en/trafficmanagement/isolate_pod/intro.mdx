# Introduction

## Pod Isolation Introduction
Pod Isolation enables immediate traffic cutoff to malfunctioning Pods while maintaining their operational state. This feature:

- Prevents request failures from defective Pods
- Maintains service availability during troubleshooting
- Allows seamless reintegration after repair

Core purpose: Ensure service continuity by dynamically managing endpoint participation

## Advantages
- ​**Quick Isolation**
  Single-click removal from service mesh without pod termination

- ​**Stability Preservation**
  Maintains optimal success rates by excluding faulty instances

- ​**K8s Native Integration**
  Works with standard Deployment resources

- ​**Observability**
  Integrated with monitoring dashboards for health validation

## Scenarios
- ​**Abnormal Pod Handling**
  Isolate Pods with elevated 5xx errors or latency spikes

- ​**Maintenance Windows**
  Temporarily remove nodes during infrastructure updates

- ​**Performance Debugging**
  Test fixes on isolated Pod without affecting production traffic

- ​**Rolling Recovery**
  Gradually reintroduce repaired Pods after validation

## Limitations
- ​**State Constraints**
  Only affects Running Pods, excludes Completed/CrashLoopBackOff

- ​**Version Compatibility**
  Legacy services require label updates (asm.cpaas.io/msselector)

- ​**Conflict Scenarios**
  Disabled during canary releases and horizontal scaling events

- ​**Persistence**
  Isolation resets on pod restart or scale-down operations
