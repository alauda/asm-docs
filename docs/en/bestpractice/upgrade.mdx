:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document should be provided; otherwise, it is not necessary to provide one.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, and other relevant information.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory format, with separate upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view examples of corresponding documents.
