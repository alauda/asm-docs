1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functions, target users, and intended use, offering readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We generally determine whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview based on the overall length of the document. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be merged into the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

The points involved with a product or functional module can be numerous, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: serve as an opening to provide a consistent understanding, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: offer readers a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: reduce the time spent on repetitively explaining foundational product knowledge.

3. How to Conceive the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: summarize the core points of the product using straightforward language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: emphasize the product's unique selling propositions and main functions.
- Audience-Focused: consider the background of the target audience and provide the information they care about.

4. Special Features of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in the documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the product's functional value, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize the product features.

We notice some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: the applicable scenarios for the product will be more comprehensive and should be explained in conjunction with different module characteristics.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the individual module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.
