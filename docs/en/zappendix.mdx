Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional module (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document to introduce multiple concepts; otherwise, it is recommended to introduce each concept in a separate document. For obscure and complex concepts, it is advisable to write a standalone article "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for clear and comprehensive introduction.

You can visit the [concept documentation example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) for corresponding document examples.
