# How to Set the Region for a Cluster

:::tip
Generally, public cloud clusters come with region attributes. This document explains how to set the region attribute for self-built clusters on the platform or private deployment clusters connected to the platform.
:::

* If you need to set the region for a **cluster to be added** to the mesh, refer to [Set Region for a Cluster](@console-platform-docs/zh/platform-usermanual/clusterall/1cluster/13clustermanagement/#region).

* If you need to set the region for a **cluster already added** to the mesh, follow the steps below:

    1. Perform the operation [Set Region for a Cluster](@console-platform-docs/zh/platform-usermanual/clusterall/1cluster/13clustermanagement/#region).
    
    2. Log in to any control node of the cluster and execute the following command to restart the Istiod component deployed in the cluster:
    
        ```sh
        # If the version number of Istiod is 1.18, the default name of the Istiod Deployment is “istiod-1-18”; Istiod is deployed in the istio-system namespace by default.
        kubectl rollout restart deployment <Istiod Deployment Name> --namespace=<Istiod Namespace>
        ```
    
    3. Execute the following command to restart all services in the cluster that have Sidecar injected:
    
        ```sh
        kubectl rollout restart deployment <Service Deployment Name> --namespace=<Service Namespace>
        ```
