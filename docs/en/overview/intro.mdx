1. What is an Introduction

The “Introduction” section serves as the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overall description of the product or functionality. It encompasses core concepts, primary features, target users, and intended uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and overview of functionalities in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate this content into individual documents; for single functional modules, it can be combined into one document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

Given the many aspects involved in a product or functional module, including an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Serve as a consistent recognition from the start, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provide clear product background for readers, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Reduce the time spent explaining the foundational understanding of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using succinct language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main features of the product.
- Audience-oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide the information they care about.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the value of product functions, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product features.

When comparing product-level introductions with module-level introductions, we find some differences:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive and need to be described in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Apart from the introduction in this section, if other sections are too long or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This is a brief description. It specifically introduces the intended use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module designed for cloud-native applications, built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster, significantly simplifying the process for enterprises to move applications to the cloud, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-grade container cloud management platform.
