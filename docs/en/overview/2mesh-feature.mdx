| **Service Topology**     | The service topology graph intuitively presents the relationships between services within the service mesh and between services inside and outside the mesh (e.g., middleware, virtual machine services injected with [OpenTelemetry Java Agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation)). The topology graph helps you understand which components communicate and quickly pinpoint the exact location of errors.<br/><br/>- Focus from global to local and view detailed information of a particular service, including service status, request conditions, traffic information, etc.<br/>- When services are configured with security, circuit breaker, and alert strategies, these are also displayed with special markers in the topology graph.<br/>- Determine the health status of service pods by node color.<br/>- Determine the status of traffic between services by connection color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Tracing**              | The platform's tracing feature supports querying the call chain between services in the current namespace by service name or TraceID, monitoring key indicators such as the call status and duration of services in the call chain. Combined with detailed log data, this helps developers understand the response of each node or specific API in the business request chain for quick problem localization and resolution.<br/><br/>- Facilitates in-depth analysis of calls between services by development and operations personnel.<br/>- Displays a scatter plot abstracted from the start and duration time of the call chain to quickly identify low-performance links.<br/>- Supports full-link tracking (services in Service Mesh architecture, Java 8+ services).<br/>- Quickly locate call chains by TraceID.<br/>- Query link information based on service or TraceID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Service Gateway**      | The service gateway, including egress and ingress gateways, operates at the edge of the service mesh, managing the traffic entering and leaving the service mesh, allowing you to specify permitted traffic. <br/><br/>- Configure multiple ingress or egress gateways for the service mesh, with each gateway allowing access through multiple customizable ports.<br/>- The ingress gateway supports routing external traffic to different backend resources (API groups, services) through various routing scenarios; the egress gateway allows services within the mesh to access external services without affecting the development experience and monitors traffic to them.<br/>- Supports a variety of usage scenarios, such as network isolation between business areas, dedicated gateways for specific businesses, and port isolation.<br/>- Easily decommission gateways that are no longer needed without loss.<br/>- Authenticate and authorize client requests based on JWT.<br/>- Configure gateway routing rules based on request path, request header, and URI rewriting.<br/>- Supports pod-level gateway monitoring, with multiple built-in alert strategies to help users detect and resolve issues promptly. Monitoring data includes CPU, memory, QPS, connection count, inbound and outbound traffic metrics. |
| **Native Resource List** | Allows users familiar with Kubernetes to view Istio native resources (YAML files) categorized by resource type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Service Disaster Recovery

In multi-region, multi-data center scenarios, when a service pod in a data center fails and is isolated by circuit breaking, the platform will automatically distribute
the client's traffic to service pods in other data centers to ensure stable service provision.

|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proximity Routing**                 | All service calls default to proximity routing in all data centers. When the call chain nodes are long, it effectively ensures that disaster recovery traffic is prioritized for processing by the same cluster's service endpoint. |
| **Custom Disaster Recovery Priority** | Allows configuring regional loads to customize the disaster recovery load priority of disaster recovery traffic across multiple clusters based on the region where the clusters are located.                                        |
