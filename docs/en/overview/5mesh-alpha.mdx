Functions on the platform can be classified into Alpha version, Beta version, and GA (General Availability) version according to their maturity.

Beta version and GA (General Availability) version functions are either stable or in the process of stabilization iteration. Professional teams provide support and services. You can use the corresponding functions in production environments according to your actual needs.

Alpha version functions may have defects or serious bugs and are not enabled in production environments by default. They are only recommended for use in environments set up for experiencing or testing platform functionality.

To help you distinguish Alpha version functions, in the left-hand directory structure of the document, modules or specific functions that are in Alpha version will be marked with `Alpha` in the navigation menu. For example: EnvoyFilter (Alpha).

The following table describes the maturity level of platform functions and their recommended usage scope.

| **Alpha** | <ul><li>May have defects and errors, enabling it may encounter serious bugs.</li><li>Supported functions may be removed at any time without notice.</li><li>Changes in API, product scenarios, interaction processes, etc., may cause compatibility issues, but will not be specifically declared in subsequent releases.</li><li>If the dependent Kubernetes feature is in Alpha version, the corresponding platform function can only be in Alpha version.</li></ul> | Alpha version functions are disabled by default in private environment deployments. They can be enabled by configuring relevant parameters if necessary.<br/>Due to the risk of bugs and possible lack of long-term support, it is recommended to use them only in short-term functional experience or test environments, such as Proof of Concept (POC) environments.                                            |
| **Beta**  | <ul><li>May have defects, but all supported functions will not be easily removed.</li><li>API parameters, product design details, etc., may change with version iterations. In such cases, we will provide instructions for migrating to the next version. Careful operation is required when performing editing operations, and applications dependent on the function may need to be disabled.</li></ul>                                                             | Beta version functions are enabled by default and can be disabled by configuring relevant parameters during deployment.<br/>There may be incompatible changes in subsequent versions, so it is recommended for use only in non-critical business operational environments. If there are multiple clusters that can be independently upgraded, this restriction can be relaxed for use in production environments. |
| **GA**    | <ul><li>Stable version of the function, will appear in many subsequent versions.</li><li>API parameters, product design details, etc., may change with long-term support versions.
