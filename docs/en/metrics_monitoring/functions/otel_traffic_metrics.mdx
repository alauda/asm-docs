# OpenTelemetry Traffic Metrics

The platform offers a wealth of traffic metrics data, allowing users to analyze the quality of service traffic from multiple dimensions.

## Service Traffic Monitoring

### Viewing Service Traffic Quality

**Prerequisites**

The service has been injected with a Java Agent, please refer to [Adding Services](../../microservice/todo-add-otel-service.md) for implementation.

**Steps**

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Monitoring**.
2. Select the service and time range for which you want to view monitoring data.

   **Note**: The query time range is limited by the retention period of Prometheus monitoring data. For example, if monitoring data is retained for up to 7 days and the set time range is for the last 30 days, the statistical data will cover only 7 days.

3. Click the respective tabs to view the service's traffic monitoring data and JVM monitoring data.

### <span id="refresh">Regular Operations</span>

- **Refresh Data**: The monitoring statistics on the current page are automatically refreshed only once when the page is opened. To refresh again, you can use the following two methods:

  - Manual Refresh: Click the <img src="../assets/metric_refresh.png" style={{display: "inline", verticalAlign: "middle"}} /> in the bottom right corner of the page to manually refresh the data.

  - Set Auto Refresh (default is off): Click the <img src="../assets/metric_auto_refresh.png" style={{display: "inline", verticalAlign: "middle"}} /> to set the interval for auto-refreshing the data.

- **View/Set Legend**: Click the <img src="../assets/legend.png" style={{display: "inline", verticalAlign: "middle"}} /> in the top right corner of the chart to expand the legend in the monitoring chart. Click on the legend to hide/show the corresponding curve in the chart.

- **View Monitoring Chart in Large**: Click the <img src="../assets/big_chart.png" style={{display: "inline", verticalAlign: "middle"}} /> in the top right corner of the chart to view an enlarged, more detailed monitoring chart in the pop-up dialog.

| **Client Traffic Comparison**     | **Client** refers to the client service (downstream service) that makes requests to the current service (upstream service). **Client Traffic Comparison** will compare and display the **Response Time**, **Incoming RPS**, and incoming **RPS Error Rate** (Error RPS/RPS) of different clients calling the current service.<br /><br />**Explanation**:<br />- **unknown client** refers to the collection of clients (HTTP protocol) within the service mesh that call the current service and whose traffic is not managed by OpenTelemetry.<br />- If the client belongs to the current namespace, clicking the **Trace** next to the client name will redirect to the trace page. |
