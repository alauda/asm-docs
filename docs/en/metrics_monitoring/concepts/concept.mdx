# Core Concepts

## Traffic

Data flow through a network, system, or application. This data can include user-generated requests, service responses, or data packets, encompassing various types of data flows in information technology and network environments.

## Monitoring Metrics

Quantitative data used to measure and evaluate the performance and health of systems, networks, or services. These metrics are essential elements in IT operations and system management, used for continuous monitoring of the system's health, performance, and resource utilization to ensure service stability and optimize user experience.

## JVM Monitoring

The process of tracking and analyzing the performance and resource usage of JVM instances running Java applications. The JVM is the environment that executes Java programs, allowing Java programs to run on various hardware and operating system platforms without the need for recompilation. JVM monitoring is crucial for ensuring the efficient and stable operation of Java applications.

## RPS

Stands for Requests Per Second, a key metric for measuring the performance of a system, server, or application, indicating how many requests the system can handle per second.

## TP50

Also known as P50 or median. This performance metric measures the midpoint of a dataset. For example, in the context of network response times or server processing times, **TP50** indicates that 50% of the request response times are lower than or equal to this value, representing a median response time. Common percentiles used in performance monitoring and statistical analysis include TP90 or TP99, which represent the 90th and 99th percentiles, respectively. These metrics help administrators understand the system's performance under different stress or load conditions.
