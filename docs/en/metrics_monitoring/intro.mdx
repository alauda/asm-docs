# Introduction

## Metrics Monitoring

The platform provides comprehensive traffic monitoring metrics, allowing users to analyze service traffic performance and quality from multiple perspectives. 

Additionally, the platform offers JVM monitoring, displaying JVM (Java Virtual Machine) metrics collected by the OpenTelemetry Java Agent. Metrics include GC (Garbage Collection), heap memory, non-heap memory, JVM threads, Java classes, etc. You can use the real-time monitoring data presented in the monitoring charts for performance analysis, quickly identifying memory leaks, thread anomalies, and other issues.

## Alerting

In the context of cloud-native, alerting is a key monitoring mechanism that notifies operations personnel or developers in a timely manner when potential issues arise in the system. This mechanism helps teams respond quickly and resolve issues that may affect application performance, availability, or security. The cloud-native environment is typically dynamic and distributed, containing a large number of microservices and containers, making an effective alert system a crucial component of maintaining system stability.
