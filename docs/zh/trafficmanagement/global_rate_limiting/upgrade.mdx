:::tip

If the parent module requires a separate manual upgrade process, upgrade documentation must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade documentation should include the upgrade process, upgrade configurations, rollback procedures, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, it is necessary to turn the upgrade documentation into a directory and provide the upgrade documentation for different versions in that directory (for example: “3.10 Upgrade Guide,” “3.18 Upgrade Guide”).

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documentation.
