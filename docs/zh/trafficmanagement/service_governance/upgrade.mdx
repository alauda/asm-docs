:::tip

If the parent module requires manual upgrade operations separately, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it may not be necessary.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes for different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory that provides upgrade documents for each version (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view examples of the corresponding documentation.
