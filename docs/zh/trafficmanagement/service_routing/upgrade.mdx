:::tip

If the parent module requires a separate manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes across different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documents.
