:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

The "Concepts" introduced in the architecture are recommended to be linked to the corresponding sections of "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "Concept" is relatively simple and does not require separate documentation, it can be briefly explained in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" under the current directory for a more accessible introduction.

You can visit [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to see the sample document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this feature, which may include the following content:

- Core Components: For example, Operators, Tasks, Middleware, etc., depicting the relationships between each component and their roles in the diagram.
- Data Flow: For example, the resources introduced, the dependencies between resources, and the flow of resource consumption, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: For example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description of the image below the architecture diagram to explain the meaning of the image and the roles of each part.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts".
